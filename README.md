The repository contains Data Structure And Algorithms Concept and Solution as well as covered Competitive programming problem solution.


### How to contribute?
* Fork the repository
* Do the desired changes (add/delete/modify)
* Make a pull request
### When to contribute?
* If there is no solution to a problem in the main branch.
* If your solution is asymptotically faster than the one in the main branch.
* If your algorithm is of the same time complexity but with reduced code size. In this case, comment out the original solution & make a pull request with your solution.
* If you have another method of solving the problem which is asymptotically slower than the original method then, comment your solution in the main file & make a pull request.
